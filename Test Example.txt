TEST EXAMPLE

This is a test example to evaluate functions makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve

1. Run both functions on Rstudio console

2. Define a 2x2 matrix called M
> M <- matrix(1:4, ncol=2, nrow=2)

3. Store the value of running makeCacheMatrix(M) which is a list.
> cacheM <- makeCacheMatrix(M)

4. Compute, cache, and return the inverse of matrix M
> cacheSolve(cacheM)

     [,1] [,2]
[1,]   -2  1.5
[2,]    1 -0.5

5. Show the original matrix stored
> cacheM$get() 

     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3
[2,]    2    4

6. Show the inverse of the matrix stored
> cacheM$getInverse()

     [,1] [,2]
[1,]   -2  1.5
[2,]    1 -0.5

7. Show the inverse of M called from cache
> cacheSolve(cacheM)  

getting cached data
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]   -2  1.5
[2,]    1 -0.5
